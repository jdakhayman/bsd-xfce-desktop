# bsd-xfce-desktop
Build an xfce desktop with FreeBSD

Config Script: Primary Desktop version 0.1.0 ( Last changed on 05/16/15_5:26pm)

This is my Primary script for personal use in my home and my office.

It is configured on top of FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE 
and is using both ports and pre-built binaries.

This script uses Xfce 4.12 as the Desktop Enviroment

It is, as it stands now, very customized to my personal needs
and has gone though several versions even before I started to
number it. It's beginning purpose was for a rapid
reinstall of a gui or faster deployment on multiple machines in a
small office.

But as I worked on it, this script became more custom for my setup.
Alter it as needed to fit your needs.
As can be seen I have opted for a full desktop in xfce along with a few
extra things that I prefer.
This is not considered a light-weight install, but dependent on 
the stuff you install you can keep your package count below 400.              
That's not to bad imho.
